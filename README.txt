Just a little side disclaimer, nothing to big:
                        
    I have no clue if this works *fully* or not. I made this like maybe a month or two ago,
    and never got the chance to upload it to github. From what I remember and for sure know
    is that window grabbing works.

TO ACTUALLY USE THIS, IMPORT "prbw3.py".
